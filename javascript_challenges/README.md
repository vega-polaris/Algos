## JavaScript Challenges... in Python?

While my bootcamp background is in JavaScript (which is why most of this repo is in that language), my past year has involved not a single line of it. Instead, I spent the year coding in Python.
As my interest in backend applications and SRE principles grows, I want to grow that Python skill. But since I learned the language on the fly, I find that there are many little details that I learned about JavaScript but never had the chance to learn about Python.
Emma Bostian's "JavaScript Challenges" course is excellent, because it starts simple and becomes more complex, and leans on the essentials of JavaScript. I find that translating her instruction to Python helps me make new connections in my head, and teaches me more about both languages.
